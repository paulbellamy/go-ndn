# Go-NDN [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulbellamy/go-ndn.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/paulbellamy/go-ndn)

An experimental work-in-progress client for [Named Data Networking](http://named-data.net/).
 Built as a way for me to reverse-engineer and learn the protocol. Includes a dockerfile for
running nfd and nrd.

## Development

Start NFD with "fig up".
